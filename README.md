 - Retail Customer Behavior & Segmentation Analysis
End-to-End Data Analytics Project using the UCI Online Retail Dataset

🎯 Project Overview

This project replicates a real-world analytics workflow similar to what a Data Analyst at Google or Meta might perform.
Using the UCI Online Retail dataset, analyzed customer transactions to uncover:

Revenue trends & seasonal behavior 📈

Product performance & sales distribution 📦

High-value customer segments via RFM analysis 💎

The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven insights can support business growth, retention, and marketing optimization — core functions of data analytics teams at leading tech companies.

🧩 Dataset Summary

Features: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

Region: Primarily UK customers
🧰 Tools & Technologies
Category	Stack
Language	Python 
Libraries	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Environment	Jupyter Notebook
Data Format	Excel → CSV outputs, PNG visualizations
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Performed rigorous preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency:

Removed cancelled invoices (InvoiceNo starting with “C”)

Filtered positive Quantity and UnitPrice values

Dropped rows missing CustomerID

Converted InvoiceDate to datetime format

Created TotalPrice = Quantity × UnitPrice

Removed duplicates


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1️⃣ Top Products by Sales & Revenue

Identified SKUs driving the highest revenue and sales volume.
Revealed which products contribute disproportionately to profits — an example of Pareto (80/20) distribution in retail.

2️⃣ Monthly Revenue Trend

Displays strong seasonality — peak months likely align with holiday campaigns.

This pattern can guide inventory planning and marketing spend allocation.

3️⃣ Distribution of Order Values (Log Scale)

Most orders are between $100 – $1,000.

A long-tail pattern exists — few high-value orders generate a large portion of total revenue.

Typical of marketplaces like Amazon, Meta Ads, or Google Shopping.

4️⃣ Cumulative Distribution of Order Values

~90 % of orders are below a few thousand dollars.

Highlights skewed spending behavior and reinforces the need for customer segmentation.

🧮 RFM (Recency–Frequency–Monetary) Analysis
Metric	Description	Business Meaning
Recency (R)	Days since last purchase	Measures engagement freshness
Frequency (F)	Number of invoices	Indicates loyalty and repeat behavior
Monetary (M)	Total spend	Reflects customer lifetime value (CLV)

We assigned quintile scores (1 – 5) and built an RFM_Score to classify customers.

Customer Segments
Segment	Description	Business Strategy
🏆 Champions	Recent, frequent, high-spending	Reward with loyalty programs
💎 Loyal	Repeat buyers with good recency	Maintain retention
⚠️ At Risk	Previously active, now dormant	Re-engagement campaigns
💤 Dormant	Low frequency & old activity	Consider churned
🌱 Potential	Moderate recency or spend	Target for upselling

 Output: rfm_table.csv

💡 Key Insights

The business relies heavily on high-value “champion” customers for revenue.

Seasonal revenue spikes highlight the importance of time-based promotions.

The long-tail effect shows that a small percentage of customers drive most sales.

RFM segmentation provides actionable marketing insights:

Personalize offers to retain loyal customers

Target at-risk customers with win-back campaigns

Identify growth opportunities within “potential” segments

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
